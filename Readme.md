slights
=======

Slights is an http server written pure ooc. It started off as a C++ program and then was re-written entirely in ooc.
It supports multiple hosts, cgi applications, directory listing and more. 

To work, this needs to be compiled with the rock version found on my github page, until the pull request I sent is accepted.
