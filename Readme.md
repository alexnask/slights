slights
=======

Slights is an http server written pure ooc. It started off as a C++ program and then was re-written entirely in ooc.
It supports multiple hosts, cgi applications, directory listing and more. 


Currently i am writting down the new structure of slights to try to make something much better than it's c++ version.
Will start working on actual code (very) soon
